% [CTxWF, CNoTx, PfTxWF, P, N] = jCapacity(Hf, P, N)
%
% Computes the capacity in bits/s/Hz (bps/Hz) for frequency-selective 
% wireless channels defined as a set of parallel channels in the frequency
% domain. The capacity is computed with channel knowledge at the
% transmitter side by using water filling power allocation over frequency
% (CTxWF) and without channel knowledge at the transmitter side (except 
% the knowledge of the SNR), thus the power is equally allocated over all
% frequencies (CNoTx).
%
% Input parameters:
%   Hf : attenuation values (channel coefficients). The dimension of Hf is
%     assumed like this:
%       size(hn) = [L, nRA, nTA]
%     where:
%       L is the number of frequency bins (number of parallel channels in the
%         frequency domain.
%       nRA = number of receive antennas.
%       nTA = number of transmit antennas.
%   P : sum power in linear units. The total transmit power. 
%     It is very important to note that in the case of capacity withouth
%     channel knowledge at the transmitter side all frequencies allocate
%     the same amount of power equal to: P / size(Hf, 1)
%   N : noise power in linear units.
%
% Output parameters:
%   CTxWF : resulting capacity in bps/Hz with channel knowledge at the
%     transmitter side (water filling capacity).
%   CNoTx : resulting capacity in bps/Hz without channel knowledge at the
%     transmitter side.
%   PfTxWF: transmit power per frequency bin, i.e., the water filling
%     coefficients. Restriction: sum(PfTxWF) <= P. The transmit power
%     coefficients for the case when no channel knowledge at the
%     transmitter is available are always equal to P / size(Hf, 1).
%   P,N can be recovered again.
